# Object Tracking Using Extended Kalman Filter
This project is developed as part of Udacity Self Driving Car Engineer Nano Degree program.

<--- This is a work in progress --->

In this project a pedestrian is tracked using a Kalman filter. Only LASER measurements are used to track the pedestrian.

## 1. Kalman filter
Kalman filter is basically a two-step estimation problem that consists of:

a. **State prediction**: use the available information to predict the state of the object (e.g., a robot, pedestrian, car) in 
consideration until the next measurement is available.

b. **Measurement update**: use new observations (a combination of the state prediction and new measurement) to correct the belief 
about the state of the object.

- Multiple sensors (e.g.,LASER, RADER) does the above state prediction and measurement update asynchronously.
- LASER provides measurements in Cartesian coordinates. If measurements are generated by LASER then we can apply a standard 
Kalman filter to update object state.
- RADAR provides measurement in POLAR coordinates. RADAR measurements involve a non-linear measurement function. 
So, different tricks are applied to handle measurement update, e.g., Extended Kalman filter.

## 2. Project Description
The main components of the project are:
- Eigen
- kalman_filter.cpp
- tracking.cpp
- measurement_package.h
- main.cpp

### Eigen
This is an open source package which is used for matrix and vector operations.

### kalman_filter.cpp
This file implements the KalmanFilter class with the following functions
- the Predict() function that predicts the location of a pedestrian.
- the Update() function that updates the predicted (by Predict() function) location of the pedestrian using 
the new LASER measurement.

The corresponding header file, kalman_filter.h declares the KalmanFilter class with its functions and parameters.

### tracking.cpp
This file implements the tracking class. Using a constructor it initializes the state vector x_, covariance matrix P_,
measurement matrix H_,
